Machine Learning Conference Palić 2023 :: Intro to ML Workshop

On the zeroth day of the [ML Conference Palić 2023](https://ml-conference.rs/), held at [InspiraHub](https://inspirahub.rs/) in Subotica, the [DataKolektiv](https://www.datakolektiv.com/) team conducted a one-day, free workshop on Introduction to Machine Learning for a selected group of participants.

In four sessions of 90 minutes each, we covered the following topics:

- Historical and conceptual introduction to Machine Learning (Goran S. Milovanović)
- Introduction to vector arithmetic and data management in Python (Numpy, Pandas) (Ilija Lazarević)
- Optimization of Linear Regression model (Goran S. Milovanović)
- Linear associator and Backpropagation algorithm for a single-layer neural network (Aleksandar Cvetković).

The participants were provided with a comprehensive overview of the mathematical foundations of all the discussed models and Python code, enabling them to independently optimize these elementary models used in ML from scratch.
